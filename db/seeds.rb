# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ cycle_name: 'Chicago' }, { cycle_name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(cycle_name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Cycle.create([{cycle_name: 'Cash'}, {cycle_name: 'Accounts Receivable'}, {cycle_name: 'Prepaid Assets'},
#   {cycle_name: 'Inventory'}, {cycle_name: 'Capital Assets'}, {cycle_name: 'Intangible Assets'},
#   {cycle_name: 'Investments'}, {cycle_name: 'Other Assets'},{cycle_name: 'Accounts Payable'},
#   {cycle_name: 'Accrued Expenses'}, {cycle_name: 'Debt'}, {cycle_name: 'Equity'}, {cycle_name: 'Revenue'},
#   {cycle_name: 'Operating Expenses'}, {cycle_name: 'Income Taxes'}, {cycle_name: 'Reporting'},
#   {cycle_name: 'Concluding'}])
